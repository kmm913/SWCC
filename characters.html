                  <p class="pt-2">Name: Baas Redclaw (Kyle)</p>
                  <p>Race: Nosaurian</p>
                  <p>Gender: Male</p>
                  <p>Age: 42</p>
                  <p>Height: 1.83m</p>
                  <p>Class: Soldier</p>
                  <p>
                    Baas served as a soldier under the famed Nosaurian General Rootrock, making a name for himself as 
                    a skilled marksman, ruthless tactician, and an extreme hothead. The latter kept him from ever becoming an officer, 
                    but his loyalty to his homeworld and his skill on the battlefield led General Rootrock to assign him to the Jedi Master
                    Dass Jennir's personal unit. Despite his typical disdain for humans (as shared by all Nosaurians), Baas eventually came to
                    respect Jennir, and by extension, the Jedi order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Baas was absent from the Battle of Half-Axe Pass (where General Rootrock and his army were wiped out by Darth Vader's 501st), 
                    having been ordered by Jennir to help oversee the safe departure of Nosaurian civilians. Baas is simultaneously thankful 
                    and ashamed that he didn't die with his comrades that day, a fact that now causes him significant inner turmoil and bolsters
                    his recklessness. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Baas's personal philosophy can best be described as "benevolent nihilism". A large part of him believes he should have died on 
                    New Plympto 18 years ago, and the cold indifference shown to Nosaurians by the rest of the galaxy has stoked a fire of rage and 
                    bitterness towards most non-Nosaurians. However, his time serving under a Jedi Master taught him that there is much strength to
                    be found in compassion, and an inherent value to life. Thus, while he doesn't really care about his own safety, he won't stand idly
                    by and watch others suffer at the hands of evil or injustice.
