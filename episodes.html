                    <p id="subtitle">THE TIPSY FELUCIAN</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A Bothan, a Nosaurian, and a Zabrak walk into a bar.</p>
                    <p>Specifically a bar called the Tipsy Felucian in Bonestell Spaceport on the planet Gelliwek.</p>
                    <p>
                        And Specifically Ka’aramo (Sharon), a Bothan unlicensed clinical social worker pursuing dubious research, 
                        Baas Redclaw (Kyle), a Nosaurian soldier looking for a new way to make ends meet and maybe get a little revenge 
                        on Imperial fat cats, and Mira (Anakin), a teenage Zabrak scout seeking to pay down a distressingly large debt 
                        to a distressingly creepy uncle under distressingly mysterious circumstances. All three were waiting to make 
                        contact with a Sluissi Freebooter named Mingyar to secure employment with the pirate band.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly, a Barabel thug known to locals as Mr. Trouble with few of his thuggiest friends burst into the bar, 
                        punched out the waitress, and demanded everyone’s cash at blasterpoint.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bartender hit the deck, the patrons scattered for cover, Bas and Mira drew guns, but Ka’aramo calmly 
                        stood up and offered to buy Mr. Trouble a drink. Not expecting this kind of reaction to armed robbery, the 
                        thugs were taken aback and dropped their guard enough for Bas and Mira to open fire from behind cover. 
                        As the fight escalated, Mr. Trouble decided to try holding Ka’aramo hostage, assuming this odd Bothan was 
                        someone important, but instead found she had a hold-out blaster suddenly in hand a firing into his gut. 
                        Before Mr. Trouble could enact revenge on the upstart, Bas moved in to flank and delivered a vicious 
                        claw strike that severed a few jugulars and reduced the thug to a bloody heap. The remaining mooks were 
                        swiftly dispatched, save one survivor who staggered away with a single hit point to his name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was talk of maybe pursuing him into the night, but first; “about that drink…”  
                    </p>
